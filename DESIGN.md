'application.py' is the central building block for Mixed Media. It has three functions: a main function and two article fetching functions. The GET part of the main function prompts the user for a keyword input via a search bar, and the POST part uses the input keyword to search and return two article json dicts using newsAPI, using the 'articlesl' and 'articlesr' functions.
In 'articlesl' and 'articlesr' functions, I create a string variable of media outlets for each function, in order to easily edit and inject the list into the API request URL. The URL contains the filters for the search such as sorting method and language. I use published date as the main sorting method so that users can have access to breaking news, and restrict search results to english articles. From these functions, I return json dictionaries of articles in order to easily parse information I need using Jinja in HTML files.
In 'results.html' I created two columns side by side with different background colors for easy understanding of right and left media. I decided to use the for loop in Jinja to create hyperlinks because that way I can make a list of hyperlinks easily. This page also includes an additional search bar, where the user can easily search for other keywords they are interested in.
